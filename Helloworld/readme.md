# Introduction to the hello world syntax

**We wrote something like**

fn main () {
    println!("Hello world");
}

fn main is the entry point in the program

what did we learn ? 

Nothing much just about the syntax and also about the rust workspace 

We have to reload the rust-analyzer extension when it's not workings also,
To initialize the rust file without git what we have to do is we have to type this command:- cargo init --vcs none

Thank you :)
