** Statements and Expressions **

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression. So far, the functions we’ve covered haven’t included an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand. Other languages don’t have the same distinctions, so let’s look at what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of functions.

Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.

Expressions evaluate to a resultant value. Let’s look at some examples.
